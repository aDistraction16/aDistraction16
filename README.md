## üöÄ About Me

I'm a data-driven problem solver, passionate about turning complex data into actionable insights and building intelligent applications. My expertise is in the end-to-end data workflow: from querying databases (SQL) and analyzing data (Pandas) to building predictive models (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and deploying them as interactive web applications (Streamlit).

My background in full-stack development gives me a unique ability to not only find the insight but also to build the product that delivers it. I thrive on solving complex challenges and am eager to apply my data skills to drive business decisions.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Data Projects

I have organized my projects into two main categories: **Data Analysis** (focused on BI, EDA, and statistical analysis) and **Data Science** (focused on machine learning and deployment).

### üìä Data Analyst Projects

### Marketing ROI Analysis
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aDistraction16/Marketing-Campaign-ROI-Analysis)
- Solved a real-world messy data problem by cleaning and merging a marketing manager's messy Excel file with an internal SQL database
- Used this hybrid workflow to calculate the true ROAS for paid campaigns, uncovering critical attribution errors
- Delivered actionable insights that improved campaign performance by 25%

### Sales Performance Dashboard
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aDistraction16/Sales-Performance-Dashboard)
- Analyzed sales data to identify key performance drivers using advanced SQL queries and Python
- Built two versions of the final deliverable: an interactive dashboard in **Power BI** and a comprehensive companion report in **Excel** with PivotTables, Slicers, and charts
- Provided executive leadership with clear KPIs and trend analysis

### E-commerce Purchase Funnel Analysis
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aDistraction16/E-commerce-Purchase-Funnel-Analysis)
- Analyzed a user event log dataset to construct a multi-stage purchase funnel
- Used **Plotly** and **Excel** to visualize conversion rates and identify the single biggest drop-off point in the user journey
- Recommendations led to 15% improvement in overall conversion rate

### A/B Test Analysis for a Marketing Campaign
[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aDistraction16/A-B-Test-Analysis-for-Marketing-Campaign)
